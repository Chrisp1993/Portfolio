# Projects

## Weather-i
Weather-i is a group project I collaborated on with other developers. The purpose of weather-i was a web application that allows you get a weekly or hourly forecast based on your location. My role was to design the initial website using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The other developers then added their web apis allowing for the functional features. 

## Run Buddy
Run-Buddy is a mock fitness website for a fitness program. The site features signup forms for the program. I used HTML and CSS to build the site.
